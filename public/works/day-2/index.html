    <hr />
    <h3>1. Go</h3>
    <p>Go, also called Golang or Go language, is an open source programming 
        language that Google developed. Software developers use Go in an array
        of operating systems and frameworks to develop web applications, cloud 
        and networking services, and other types of software. Go is statically 
        typed, explicit and modeled after the C programming language.

    <h3>2. Python</h3>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming 
        language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, 
        combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive 
        for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
        or glue language to connect existing components together.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Java</h3>
    <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by 
        Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power 
        a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform 
        upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products 
        and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
